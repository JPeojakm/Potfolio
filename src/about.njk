        <h1>Data Journalism, Tech news...</h1>
        <p>
          Hey, I‚Äôm Jinpeng Li, or JP. I was born and raised in Xi'An City in China.
        </p>

        <p>
          From a very young age, I started building and creating things using words. My finest hours before moving to U.S. include my first long piece novel helping me win the 20th <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FD5B25;">New Concept Writing Competition</span>, which has produced many influential youth writers in China; my first screenplay helped me win the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FD5B25;">Walt Disney Fellowship </span> nationwide (you can expect to see it on the screen one day); and my first reporting helped me secure a newsroom internship at Yi Magazine, one of the best business magazines in China.
       </p>

       <p>
          I stumbled around Hainan University for three years learning <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FD5B25;">finance</span>. Since the college is built on a tropical island, I drank coconut water, and bathed in sunshine and sea wind every day. I published <a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/35437296/" class= "link">my first book</a> reflecting on the Chinese exam-oriented education system at this time. I finally figured out I hate the bro culture in the industry so can't be a finance trust fund 6'5''guy. But it make me become a business reporter intern - worked in the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FD5B25;">Consumer beat and Electric Vehicle beat</span> for <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FD5B25;">Yicai and Caixin media</span>.
       </p>

        <p>
          I completed my graduate studies in <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FD5B25;">Journalism and Media</span> at the University of Texas at Austin, <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FD5B25;">mostly taking courses in journalism, informatics, and urban design</span>. I spent my days crunched data and visualized them for fun. I‚Äôm proud to be a student at the J-school; I believe J-school and newsrooms are among the most conducive environments for experimentation, development, and creativity.
       </p>
          
        <p>In Nov. 2023, I started working on <a href="https://theabacus.substack.com/" class="link">The Abacus</a> with my friend Oliver Taylor, a media brand <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FD5B25;">we created</span> reporting AI news in Asia, and everything I‚Äôm interested in the Tech industry and people.
        </p>

        <p>
        At the same time, I'm a contributor at <a href="https://theinitium.com/zh-Hans" class="link">Initium Media </a>, where I cover AAPI community.
        </p>

         <p>Besides work, I‚Äôm an Asian restaurant aficionadoü•¢üç≤ and outdoor sports enthusiast‚õ∞Ô∏èüåä. A life goal of mine is I want a garden and a library of my own.
