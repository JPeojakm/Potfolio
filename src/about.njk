        <h1>Data Journalism, Tech news...</h1>
        <p>
          Hey, I‚Äôm Jinpeng Li, or JP. I'm from Xi'an City in China.
        </p>

        <p>
          From a very young age, I started building and creating things using words. My finest hours before moving to U.S. include my first long piece novel helping me win the 20th <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FD5B25;">New Concept Writing Competition</span>, which has produced many influential youth writers in China; my first screenplay helped me win the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FD5B25;">Walt Disney Fellowship </span> nationwide (you can expect to see it on the screen one day); and my first reporting helped me secure a newsroom internship at Yi Magazine, one of the best business magazines in China.
       </p>

       <p>
          I stumbled around Hainan University for three years learning <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FD5B25;">finance</span>. Since the college is built on a tropical island, I drank coconut water, and bathed in sunshine and sea wind every day. I published
          <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FD5B25;">first book</span> reflecting on the Chinese exam-oriented education system at this time. Finally figured out that I'm not into the brotherhood culture in finance, but it led me to start doing enterprise reporting - working on the Consumer beat and Electric Vehicle beat for <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FD5B25;">Yicai</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FD5B25;"> Caixin media</span>.
       </p>

        <p>
          I completed my graduate studies in Journalism and Media at the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FD5B25;"> University of Texas at Austin</span>, mostly taking courses in <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FD5B25;">journalism, informatics, and urban design</span>. I spent my days crunched data and visualized them for fun. I‚Äôm proud to be a student at the J-school; I believe J-school and newsrooms are among the most conducive environments for experimentation, development, and creativity.
       </p>
          
        <p>I started working on <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FD5B25;">The Abacus</span> with my friend Oliver Taylor from Nov. 2023, a media brand we created reporting AI news in Asia, and everything I‚Äôm interested in the Tech industry and people.
        </p>


         <p>
        In the summer of 2024, I was selected to be a data journalism fellow by the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FD5B25;">Dow Jones News Fund</span> to work for <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FD5B25;">The Washington Post</span> and the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FD5B25;">Investigative Reporting Workshop</span>. Dream job, dream life.  
        </p>

         <p>Besides work, I‚Äôm an Asian restaurant aficionadoü•¢üç≤ and outdoor sports enthusiast‚õ∞Ô∏èüåä. A life goal of mine is I want a garden and a library of my own.
