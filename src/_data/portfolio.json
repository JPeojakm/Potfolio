      "title": "Extreme Heat And Migration: Insights From The Arizona Border",
      "image": "Arizona_heat",
      "blurb": "The US Southwestern border is increasingly recognized as one of the world's most perilous land crossings. Alongside the myriad challenges faced by undocumented migrants, extreme heatwaves have emerged as a formidable barrier. Recently, there's been an increase in deaths caused by extreme heat, as noted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. \n\n  As a data reporter, I hope to provide more quantitative analysis and map visualizations to support these migrant stories. My project aims to understand how rising global temperatures affect migrant movements in this region. It will look at how water and emergency beacons are spread across the area, with the goal of finding ways to make the journey safer for migrants. \n\n  Firstly, here is some background. I gathered weather data from NOAA and migrant information from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and used R to analyze them. As Figure 1 shows, from 2019 to 2023, during the hottest months of June to September, there has been a notable increase in deaths among migrants trying to cross borders without permission. So, how do rising temperatures influence migration patterns along the Arizona border?\n\n  We define missing migrants as individuals who attempt to cross borders without authorization and are later found deceased by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) or patrol officers, without definitive identification at the time of discovery. Heat-related missing migrants are those whose deaths are inferred to be caused by heat, after excluding known causes like violence or drowning.\n\n  Since data on missing migrants is difficult to obtain and the specific reasons for their disappearance are often unknown, I reached out to the International Organization for Migration and an Arizona local NGO, Humane Borders, for their datasets. To increase accuracy, I focused on missing migrant cases from June to September, the hottest months in Arizona. I also narrowed down the data to include cases that could be related to heat-related causes of death.\n\n  Figure 2 provides very rich information, through this map, we can get some facts about Arizona: 1) Arizona is characterized by limited water sources and cities concentrated in the central region. 2) Tucson has become one of the fastest-growing cities in recent years due to immigration. 3) It has two patrol stations. 4) Rescue Beacons are primarily located in the lower-left corner, in Yuma County.\n\n  I use the Heat Index and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) as the main methods for this research. For my research on the impact of heat, I initially planned to use temperature and other weather data. However, I realized that this data might not clearly show trends over five years. \n\n  Then, I discovered the Heat Index in a research paper. Heat Index made by the nonprofit First Street Foundation, calculates the heat risk facing each property in the contiguous United States over the next 30 years, the length of a typical mortgage, providing some of the most detailed nationwide estimates. It uses an average temperature value over seven years, making it a more objective choice for my project. To analyze the data, I'm applying a weighted approach to the Heat Index.\n\n  As the map indicates, the deep red areas represent the hottest regions, while the lighter colored areas are relatively cooler. However, it's important to note that when looking at the national map, Arizona tends to be overall warmer in the summer. The colorful points on the map represent missing migrants, with different colors indicating different years.\n\n  Finally, I conducted a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), combining factors such as heat, distance from cities, and the presence of rescue beacons, to see how they influence migrant safety. I gained some insights from the results. Migrants should avoid walking in the FID4, 1, and 51 census tracts to minimize health risks. Additionally, NGOs and the US Border Patrol should consider installing more beacons eastward to enhance safety.\n\n  So far, this is all my work. I sent the results to Humane Borders, hoping it can contribute to their efforts in helping undocumented immigrants protect their lives. Of course, this project has many limitations, such as my inability to verify the migrant data since statistics on heat-related deaths are hard to compile. Also, the heat index data was last updated in July, not including data for August and September.\n\n  In the future, I aim to extend the study to encompass the entire US southern border for a more comprehensive analysis."

Vacant lands, a byproduct of this demographic shift, present both a challenge and an opportunity. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Cleveland’s neighborhood revitalization strategy in repurposing these lands. Utilizing the Opportunity Index compiled by the Kirwan Institute for Race and Ethnicity, along with Geographically Weighted Regression analysis, we will assess the correlation between areas of high vacancy and low opportunity. This analysis is not only pivotal for local urban development but also forms a crucial part of our application for additional program funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The hypothesis driving this research posits that Cleveland’s vacant land reuse program is adept at identifying areas with high vacancy rates and low opportunity indices, thereby targeting interventions where they are most needed."

      "blurb": "The automotive industry, particularly new automakers like Xpeng, NIO, and Li Auto, faced severe supply chain challenges in 2021. Rising upstream raw material costs, chip shortages, tight battery supplies, and disruptions caused by sporadic pandemic outbreaks have been key hurdles.\n\nDespite these challenges, Xpeng, NIO, and Li Auto are in a crucial phase of improving profitability. Their substantial R&D investments have led to strategic losses in the short term, but increasing per-vehicle profit margins suggest a potential approach towards the breakeven point in the future.\n\nIn terms of delivery volume, Xiaopeng Motors delivered 98,200 vehicles in 2021, outperforming NIO's 91,400 vehicles and Li Auto's 90,500 vehicles. However, NIO's delivery volume slightly lagged, with Nezha Auto, a second-tier competitor, selling over 18,000 vehicles in the first two months of 2022, surpassing NIO's 15,800 vehicles. Notably, Li Auto has achieved profitability.\n\nRevenue growth and profit improvement trends are upward for these automakers. NIO reported a full-year revenue of $5.42 billion in 2021, up 122% year-on-year, and a net loss narrowed by 24.3%. In terms of gross margin performance, Xpeng's new vehicle gross margin stands at 11.5%, showing an 8 percentage point increase from 2020. This improvement is attributed to product portfolio expansion, material cost reduction, and XPILOT software sales revenue. Li Auto leads with the highest new vehicle gross margin at 20.6%, closely followed by NIO at 20.1%.\n\nLi Auto's performance in Q4 2021 was particularly strong, turning a profit with a net gain of $44.33 million. The company delivered 35,000 vehicles during the quarter, achieving a vehicle gross profit margin that exceeded market expectations.\n\nDespite the ongoing chip shortage and rising battery costs, Xpeng and NIO remain optimistic. He Xiaopeng, the founder of Xpeng Auto, views these challenges as temporary and an opportunity for the company to refine its capabilities, aiming for a gross margin of over 25%.\n\nCITIC Securities' research suggests that these automakers are in an accelerating phase of profitability improvement. While significant R&D investments continue to cause short-term strategic losses, their steadily increasing single-car gross profit demonstrates their potential to reach break-even in the future."

      "blurb": "Leading Domestic Sports and Casual Apparel Brands ANTA and Li-Ning Experienced Significant Performance Improvement Last Year, but Growth Slowed in the Second Half and Stock Prices Have Been Declining Since Q3.\n\nAccording to the latest financial report, ANTA's revenue for 2021 was RMB 49.328 billion, a YoY increase of 38.90%. Compared to Nike Greater China's sales in the 2021 fiscal year, which were only RMB 1.9 billion higher, ANTA's revenue surpassed Adidas Greater China and Lululemon's full-year revenue for the 2021 fiscal year, which were RMB 32.161 billion and RMB 39.7 billion, respectively. Li-Ning's full-year revenue was RMB 22.572 billion, a YoY growth rate of 56.13%.\nThe DTC (Direct-To-Customer) transformation was the main reason for ANTA's performance improvement. The DTC transformation mainly targeted external channels, significantly reducing the proportion of distributors, increasing direct sales efforts, reducing intermediate links, and expanding profit margins.\nPreviously, ANTA's main wholesale distribution model involved selling products wholesale to distributors for exclusive distribution. In 2020, there were too many uncertain factors affecting offline stores due to the pandemic, and distributor purchases led to strong short-term market-oriented positioning.\nAs ANTA's offline store expansion space became saturated, the group began to consider DTC transformation. In the 18 regions where the DTC transformation was launched, ANTA adopted a mixed operating model, which involved recovering distributor stores and converting them into group-owned stores, while retaining some high-performing franchise stores.\nUnlike ANTA's \"single focus, multiple brands\" strategy, Li-Ning continues to adhere to its \"single brand, multiple categories\" approach, developing towards both specialization and trendiness. During the reporting period, the company's revenue from sports fashion products grew at the fastest rate of 71%, accounting for 43% of total revenue. The creativity of this category is well received by young consumers. In terms of specialization, the company's basketball and running series had revenue growth rates of 53% and 46%, respectively."

      "blurb": "CATL, a global leader in electric vehicle batteries, faced contrasting fortunes between its 2021 annual performance and the first quarter of 2022. Despite an impressive 2021 with revenue soaring to $195.53 billion (up 159.06%) and a net profit of $2.39 billion (up 185.34%), the first quarter of 2022 showed a different trend. The revenue for Q1 2022 increased significantly to $7.3 billion (up 153.9%), but the net profit took a hit, falling to $223.5 million, a 20% decrease. This was far below expectations and marked the first quarter-over-quarter decline since 2020. Additionally, the non-GAAP net profit also declined by 41.6% to $147 million.\n\nThe company's gross profit margin for Q1 2022 was 14.48%, a decrease of 10.88 percentage points from the previous quarter, and below market expectations. This led to a sharp 11.4% fall in CATL's stock price on May 5th.\n\nThe downturn in Q1 2022 can be attributed to multiple factors. There was significant pressure from rising upstream costs and weaker downstream demand from automakers. CATL's revenue primarily comes from power battery systems, energy storage systems, and battery materials. In 2021, these segments contributed 70.19%, 10.45%, and 11.86% of the revenue, respectively. The core revenue source, the power battery business, saw revenue growth of 132.06% to $13.73 billion. However, in 2022, CATL's cost advantage lessened, leading to a leveling of profit margins compared to other domestic battery manufacturers.\n\nIn the backdrop of a high-growth new energy vehicle market in 2021, CATL faced stiff competition. The company not only had to contend with the expansion of overseas battery giants but also with the rise of domestic second- and third-tier battery manufacturers and increased efforts by car companies to develop their own battery strategies. This competition put pressure on profit margins and market share. Despite maintaining the top global market share in early 2021, CATL's position was increasingly challenged by both international and domestic competitors, including innovative Chinese companies like SVOLT, EVE Energy, and Farasis Energy, which saw significant growth in their market shares and installation rates."

Despite these challenges, China's leading chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), reported impressive performance in the first quarter. This success was attributed to proactive capacity optimization and allocation adjustments made earlier. However, the long logistics chain has disrupted its existing business lines.\n\nSMIC's recent quarterly report showcased significant growth, with revenue soaring to $1.78 billion, a 62.6% increase from the previous year. The net profit for shareholders also saw a substantial rise to $426.45 million, up 175.5% year-on-year. Notably, the company's gross margin reached 40.7%, exceeding its guidance range of 36%-38%.\n\nAs the consumer electronics chip market enters a destocking phase and demand slows, the pandemic has led to a decreased capacity utilization rate for SMIC. Additionally, maintenance delays and rising raw material costs could potentially impact the company's performance in the coming second quarter. Analysts warn that SMIC may face an adjustment period extending beyond six months, given the ongoing disruptions in the supply chain and escalating raw material costs. This situation underscores the need for agility and strategic foresight in navigating the complex and evolving landscape of the global semiconductor industry."

This decline is attributed to increased investments in TaocaiCai and Tmall, ongoing pandemic impacts, and the effects of asset impairment losses and special provisions for Sun Art Retail.\n\nLooking at Alibaba's performance for the 2022 fiscal year, the results were not particularly striking. Under non-GAAP standards, the net profit was $20.46 billion, marking a 21% year-on-year decrease, a significant decline of 51 percentage points from the previous fiscal year.\n\nDespite these figures indicating a slowdown in growth and profit, major banks maintain a bullish stance on Alibaba's future prospects. This optimism may be rooted in the company's ability to navigate through challenging market conditions and its potential for long-term growth, especially considering its significant market presence and ongoing strategic investments. ​"
